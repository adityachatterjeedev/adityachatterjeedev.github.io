I’ve always found that the best way to solidify what I learn is to write it down — not as hastily scribbled notes, but as well-organized, well-formatted, and easily accessible explanations. My own little textbook, if you will.

This blog represents my first attempt to move my notetaking process from pen and paper to digital media. In doing so, I hope to not only deepen my understanding of the material but also create a resource I can return to — and maybe even something others can benefit from too.
