### Introduction

One of my goals this summer is to build a set of reference notes as I dive deeper into Machine Learning — especially Deep Learning.

I spent much of the previous semester working on training, fine-tuning, and optimizing LLMs, and I want to continue that work while also solidifying my fundamentals.

I plan to publish one post a week, each of which will be linked below.
